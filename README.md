## 1. IDEA

StockMate is an easy-to-use inventory tracker application that provides individuals with the ability to quickly keep track of items and their amounts in stock.

My goals and vision to differentiate StockMate as unique and different from pre-existing applications is to eventually incorporate ADVANCED FEATURES such as:

- **Digital Map Environment**: visually highlights the location where the item is stored.
- **AI Powered Identification**: speed up the process of adding to stock.
